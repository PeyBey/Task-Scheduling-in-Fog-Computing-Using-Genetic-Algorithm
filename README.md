# Task-Scheduling-in-Fog-Computing-Using-Genetic-Algorithm
This repository provides a simulation to schedule tasks in edge-fog  environment. The algorithm tries to find optimized fog nodes when a set of tasks arrives from sensors. The cost fuction is created to optimize makespan, cost and distaces. The optimization procedure stems from genetic algorithm.
