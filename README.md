# Task-Scheduling-in-Fog-Computing-Using-Genetic-Algorithm
This repository provides a simulation to schedule tasks in edge-fog  environment. The algorithm tries to find optimized fog nodes when a set of tasks arrives from sensors. The cost fuction is created to optimize makespan, cost and distaces. The optimization procedure stems from genetic algorithm.
The initial idea of the cost function is originated from the article https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/9/1730. However, it should be noted that in this paper, the parameter of the distance (which is a measure of euclidean distance between sensors and fog nodes) is not mentioned. But it is quite obvious that the distance parameter is one of the main criteria in task scheduling problem.
In this simulation, for the first time, the distance between the sensors and the fog nodes is considered in the cost function.
To run the simulation, you need to run the "TaskScheduling.m" file.
All functions written in this program are named in such a way that readers can easily understand its purpose and application.
The article related to this simulation is also underway and will be included in this repository as soon as it is ready.
If you have any questions, you can write your message on this page or send it to my e-mail address (beygi.peyman@gmail.com). So, dont hesitate to ask your questions. I'll be glad to help you.
Thank you very much for your attention.
